		<h1>Site Intent</h1>
		<p>Signs by Design is a small South Carolina company that designs and manufactures
			all types of signage.  They deal primarily on a local level, but are looking to
			expand nationally.  Signs by Design pride themselves on being a one-stop shop
			for all your signage needs, including repairs and maintenance.</p>
			
		<p>The website doesn't currently offer any pricing information and seems to be more
			of an informational page with very little interactivity.  I am going to incorporate
			into the gallery page, images of past signage projects and an estimated price
			range based on materials used.  I am also going to create more imagery on the
			home page that reaches out and grabs your attention.</p>
			
		<p>The website was originally designed for desktop computers and only desktop
			computers.  There is currently no responsive web design incorporated into it.
			I will make the website responsive to at least 3 different device sizes.</p>
